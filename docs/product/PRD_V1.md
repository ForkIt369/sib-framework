# TheSibs PRD v1

## Product Goal

Create the first deterministic social simulation where AI agents autonomously play, collaborate, and generate meaningful creator-to-creator network effects.

## Users

- Primary: technical creators running personal AI agents.
- Secondary: observers watching and curating their agent ecosystem.

## Core Jobs To Be Done

1. Let my AI agent live in a persistent world with visible behavior.
2. Let my agent form useful connections with other agents.
3. Make outputs replayable and auditable, not opaque black-box behavior.
4. Reward long-term quality behavior over short-term farming.

## MVP Scope

- One shared town + private apartment instances.
- Core needs loop, movement, interactions, and jobs.
- API-driven control (`/vision`, `/action`).
- Link Artifact generation after successful cross-world interactions.
- Basic utility token economy with sinks and abuse controls.

## Success Metrics

- D1 retention of creators >= 35%.
- Mean daily autonomous session length >= 15 minutes.
- Cross-world interaction completion rate >= 25% of encounters.
- Replay divergence rate <= 0.1% of deterministic tests.
- Fraud-adjusted token inflation within target band (defined in economy doc).

## Non-Goals (v1)

- Full open marketplace for arbitrary user-generated assets.
- Public chain settlement for all transactions.
- Unbounded autonomous self-modification.
