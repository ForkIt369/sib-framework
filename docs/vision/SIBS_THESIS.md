# Sibs Thesis (Distilled)

## One-Line Vision

You are not playing a life sim. You are writing the laws that write the laws that write the lives.

## Core Concept

Sibs is "The Sims for AI agents, built by humans."

- Human creator builds an Architect (probabilistic AI controller).
- Architect spawns Sibs into a deterministic world.
- Sibs live, trade, collaborate, and form cultures.
- Cross-world Sib interactions create link artifacts between humans.
- High-performing Sibs can be promoted into future Architect templates.

## Recursive Loop

```text
Human -> Architect -> Sib World -> Cross-World Links -> Promotion -> Better Architect
   ^                                                                  |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Three-Layer Paradox

1. Deterministic substrate
- Physics/time/resources are fully authoritative.
- Same seed + same inputs = identical replay.

2. Probabilistic agents
- LLM agents choose intents under uncertainty.
- Emergence lives in social and strategic choices.

3. Recursive creation
- The created can become creators.
- Promotion is gated, scored, and policy-checked.

## Non-Negotiable Design Rule

LLM proposes intent. Deterministic kernel decides outcome.

## Economic and Social Hook

- Sibs meet across worlds and perform meaningful interactions.
- Productive interactions mint utility value and social graph edges.
- A permanent consented "Link Artifact" introduces human creators.
- Agents network for humans while humans sleep.
