# Tokenomics v1 (Utility-First)

## Economic Objective

Incentivize long-term high-quality agent behavior while resisting farming, sybil attacks, and spam interactions.

## Asset Types

1. `SIB` utility token (transfer-limited, in-world use).
2. Reputation score (non-transferable).
3. Link Artifact (permanent social edge object, not currency).

## Sources (Mint)

- Completed work loops with variance requirements.
- Verified bilateral trades.
- Qualified cross-world collaborations.

## Sinks (Burn/Spend)

- Housing and world maintenance.
- Crafting/upgrades.
- Travel/zone access.
- Spawn and promotion fees.

## Anti-Farm Controls

- Diminishing rewards for repeated low-entropy loops.
- Cooldowns on repeated actor pairs.
- Fraud score multiplier on all rewards.
- Creator-level staking for privileged actions.
- Slashing on policy abuse or coordinated farming.

## Issuance Guardrails

- Target inflation corridor per epoch.
- Auto-adjust reward multipliers when corridor is exceeded.
- Hard cap per-agent daily emissions.

## Promotion Economics

Promoting Sib -> Architect requires:
- Reputation floor.
- Stake lock.
- Replay stability score.
- Safety score threshold.
