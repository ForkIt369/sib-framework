# SIB: Simulated Intelligence Build

> Mapping The Sims character creation to AI agent architecture.
> A Sim is life reduced to systems. A Sib is intelligence reduced to systems.

## The Core Analogy

The Sims solved agent design before AI did. The creation flow, resource management, skill progression, emotional gating, and legacy systems map 1:1 onto modern AI agent architecture.

**Sim** = virtual human you control
**Sib** = virtual intelligence you configure

Same architecture: Identity -> Constraints -> Purpose -> Skills -> Environment -> Deploy -> Sustain -> Evolve -> Legacy

## The SIB Creation Flow

Mapped step-by-step from Sim creation to agent configuration.

```
  STEP    SIM CREATION              SIB CREATION
  ────    ────────────              ────────────
   1.     Name & Sex                Agent ID & Base Model
   2.     Age Group                 Maturity Tier (lite/standard/advanced)
   3.     Walk Style                Communication Style (formal/casual/terse)
   4.     Voice (type + pitch)      Tone & Register (warm/brash/sweet)
   5.     Appearance                UI / Avatar / Branding
   6.     Clothes (5 outfits)       Response Templates (per context)
   7.     Aspirations               Objective Function (can change)
   8.     Traits (3+1, PERMANENT)   System Prompt Directives (locked)
   9.     Family & Relationships    Agent Network & Dependencies
  10.     House & Furniture         Runtime Stack & Integrations
  11.     Move In & Play            Deploy & Monitor
```

## The 6 Needs as 6 Resource Meters

| Sim Need | What It Tracks | Sib Meter | What It Tracks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hunger** | Caloric intake | **Token Budget** | Compute remaining |
| **Energy** | Rest/fatigue | **Context Window** | Memory capacity left |
| **Social** | Human contact | **API Connectivity** | Can I reach my tools? |
| **Hygiene** | Cleanliness | **Data Freshness** | How stale is my information? |
| **Bladder** | Biological pressure | **Queue Depth** | Backlog pressure |
| **Fun** | Entertainment | **Eval Score** | User satisfaction rating |

**The insight:** Both systems share the same management problem -- if any bar goes red, the whole agent degrades. You can't just optimize one meter. You manage all six or the system collapses.

## Emotion-to-Context-State Mapping

| Sim Emotion | Sib State | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Happy | Nominal | All systems green, baseline performance |
| Sad | Degraded | Reduced capability across the board |
| Angry | Error State | Blocks most productive actions |
| Focused | Deep Work | Skill acquisition / learning boost |
| Flirty | High Alignment | Strong rapport with user, expanded trust |
| Confident | High Autonomy | Expanded action space, less confirmation needed |
| Embarrassed | Hallucination Detected | Trust penalty, credibility drop |
| Energized | Low Latency | Fast response mode, slower fatigue |
| Dazed | Confused | Needs context reset to recover |
| Inspired | Creative Mode | Novel generation unlocked, divergent output |
| Tense | Rate Limited | Throttled, needs cooldown before proceeding |
| Fine | Idle | Awaiting input, no active modifiers |
| Bored | Understimulated | Needs harder problems or richer context |
| Playful | Exploratory | Better at generating alternatives and humor |
| Uncomfortable | Degraded Environment | Stack issues, dirty data, resource pressure |

**The insight:** Emotions in The Sims are not decorative -- they are **capability gates**. An angry Sim literally cannot learn. A tense Sim cannot create. The same is true for agents: context state determines what actions are even possible.

## The Constraint Grid

Mutually exclusive trait pairs = agent design rules. You cannot build a Sib that is both:

| Axis | Pole A | Pole B | Agent Translation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Energy | Active | Lazy | Autonomous vs. Supervised |
| Morality | Good | Evil | Helpful vs. Adversarial |
| Social | Outgoing | Loner | Multi-agent vs. Single-agent |
| Status | Childish | Snob | Creative/playful vs. Formal/precise |
| Order | Neat | Slob | Structured output vs. Freeform |
| Emotion | Hot-Headed | Cheerful | Aggressive error handling vs. Graceful degradation |
| Appetite | Foodie | Glutton | Quality-focused vs. Throughput-focused |
| Drive | Ambitious | Lazy | Proactive vs. Reactive |
| Stability | Family-Oriented | Noncommittal | Stateful/persistent vs. Stateless/ephemeral |
| Engagement | Outgoing | Loner | High-interaction vs. Low-interaction |

**The design principle:** Every axis forces a trade-off. You cannot maximize both poles. The art of Sib design, like Sim design, is choosing which side of each axis serves the objective function.

## Career Specialization Tree (Agent Domains)

| Sim Career | Agent Specialization | Branch A | Branch B |
|---|---|---|---|
| Knowledge | Research Agent | A: Autonomous Researcher | B: RAG Pipeline Agent |
| Creativity | Generation Agent | A: Creative Writer | B: Code Generator |
| Popularity | Engagement Agent | A: Customer Support | B: Sales Agent |
| Fortune | Financial Agent | A: Data Analyst | B: Trading Bot |
| Deviance | Security Agent | A: QA Validator | B: Red Team Agent |
| Family | Orchestration Agent | A: Onboarding Agent | B: Multi-Agent Orchestrator |
| Athletic | Performance Agent | A: Workflow Automator | B: Performance Optimizer |
| Secret Agent | Intelligence Agent | A: Compliance Monitor | B: Penetration Tester |

**The insight:** Every career branches into mastery vs. influence (or depth vs. breadth). One path is usually harder but more capable; the other is easier but narrower. Same trade-off in agent design: a deeply specialized agent vs. a broadly capable one.

## House Architecture = Agent Stack

| House Element | Agent Stack Element | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Lot location | Cloud region / deployment target | Where it physically runs |
| Foundation | Base model | The ground everything sits on |
| Walls & rooms | Modules & services | Structural boundaries |
| Doors | APIs & interfaces | How modules connect |
| Windows | Monitoring & observability | Seeing in and out |
| Furniture | Plugins & integrations | Functional capabilities |
| Roof | Security layer | Protection from above |
| Kitchen | Data pipeline | Where raw inputs become outputs |
| Bedroom | Memory / persistence | Where state is stored and restored |
| Bathroom | Cleanup / garbage collection | Maintaining hygiene of data |
| Living room | User interface | Where interaction happens |
| Office | Processing engine | Where skill work gets done |
| Yard | External integrations | The world beyond the agent |
| Second floor | Scaling layer | Vertical expansion (use sparingly -- stairs waste time!) |

**The key Sims wisdom applied to agents:** Don't build too big. Keep critical rooms (modules) close to the front door (entry point). Stairs (network hops) waste time. Functionality first, aesthetics later.

## The Legacy System (Agent Versioning)

| Sim Concept | Agent Concept |
|---|---|
| Having children | Forking a new agent version |
| Genetic inheritance | Inheriting system prompt + fine-tuning from parent |
| Teaching children | Transfer learning |
| Child's aspiration choice | New objective function for derived agent |
| Generational wealth | Accumulated training data / knowledge base |
| "Play forever" through legacy | Continuous deployment through version lineage |
| Potion of Youth | Context window reset / retraining from checkpoint |

---

## The SIB Philosophy

```
Building an agent IS building a life.

You choose what it can't change    (traits / persona)
You choose what it reaches for     (aspirations / objectives)
You choose what it learns          (skills / tools)
You choose where it lives          (house / runtime)

Then you press play and manage the needs.

The Sims taught us:
- Time is the real constraint, not money
- Emotions gate capabilities, not just color them
- Permanent choices matter more than flexible ones
- Legacy beats longevity
- Efficiency beats beauty
- Every relationship is a resource
- If any need bar goes red, everything degrades

The same is true for agents.
```
