## Core Essence

Showtime transforms The Sims 3 into a **performance entertainment simulator** centered around three stage careers (Singer, Magician, Acrobat), a DJ hobby system, the SimPort social feature for sharing performers across players, and the introduction of Genies as a new occult life state. The expansion builds on Ambitions' active profession framework but focuses entirely on the entertainment industry: performers audition for gigs at venues of escalating quality, queue acts from a feat library that grows with skill level, and are scored on variety, crowd engagement, and technical execution. The venue system introduces SimFest competitions where performers compete for prizes, and the SimPort feature allows players to send their performers to friends' games for gigs. The new world, Starlight Shores, is a Hollywood-inspired entertainment district built around performance venues. Every system in the expansion orbits the central question: can your Sim captivate an audience?

## Key Lexicon

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Performance Skill** | A hidden skill built through practicing and performing that determines act quality, feat success rates, and career advancement; increased faster by related visible skills (Guitar for Singers, Athletic for Acrobats) |
| **Feat** | A specific performance act (song, magic trick, acrobatic routine) queued during a gig; variety of feats in a show improves scoring |
| **Gig** | A booked performance at a venue; comes in types: One-off (single show) and Steady (recurring engagement); quality tiers from Park to Big Show |
| **SimFest** | A competitive performance event at venues where multiple Sims perform and are judged; winners earn prizes and career advancement |
| **SimPort** | A social feature allowing players to send their performers to friends' games for gigs, earning unique rewards and expanding career reach |
| **Venue** | Performance locations of escalating quality: Parks (starter) -> Coffeehouses -> Private Venues -> Live Shows -> Big Shows |

| **Stage Props** | Career-specific performance objects placed on stage (Balance Ball for Acrobats, props for Magicians) |
| **Genie** | A new occult life state obtained from Genie Lamps; grants wish-fulfillment powers, a unique interaction set, and distinctive blue skin |

| **DJ** | A hobby/side-job (not full career) using hidden DJ skill; performs at venues via DJ Booth, unlocks genres (Dubstep, Funk, Drum N Bass, Niche) |
| **Starlight Shores** | The expansion's new world -- a glamorous entertainment-focused town inspired by Hollywood/Las Vegas with multiple performance venues |
| **Make It Groove** | A DJ-specific interaction that creates a custom remix; success/failure based on DJ skill level, produces Made It Groove! or Failed to Groove moodlet |

## The Vibe

Showtime reads like a backstage pass annotated by a talent manager with a spreadsheet addiction. Every performance career is documented with the precision of a theatrical production bible: feat unlock levels, gig pay tables with venue-specific rates, badge/achievement checklists, wish catalogs, and opportunity lists that read like talent agency contracts. The three careers are carefully differentiated: Singers are the most accessible (Guitar skill transfers directly), Magicians are the most cerebral (Logic skill + complex illusion feats), and Acrobats are the most physical and dangerous (Athletic skill + fire-based feats that can fail spectacularly but never fatally). The DJ section feels like an appendix to the main careers -- a hobby system without full career progression, dependent on opportunities rather than bookable gigs. The Genie system adds a wish-fulfillment fantasy layer that sits somewhat orthogonal to the performance theme but provides a collectible-hunting endgame through the Genie Lamp. The SimPort feature represents an early attempt at asynchronous social gaming within The Sims, allowing performers to exist in a shared economy across players' games. The object catalog reveals a venue-building toolkit: stage lights, FX towers, themed props, arcade tables, and the crown jewel PlasmaPunch Gyroscopic Conductor ($7,500) whose Dimensional Gate upgrade transforms it from a carnival ride into a dungeon-crawling collectible generator. The expansion's underlying philosophy is that entertainment is a craft with learnable rules -- talent is a hidden skill, charisma is quantifiable, and even a fire-spinning faceplant builds experience.

## Core Insight

Showtime reveals that performance is a fundamentally different kind of skill expression in game design than crafting or combat. Where Ambitions' professions are scored on task completion (fire extinguished, room renovated, ghost captured), Showtime's careers are scored on **audience experience** -- variety, pacing, difficulty escalation, and showmanship. The feat queue system is essentially a set list builder, and the scoring system penalizes repetition while rewarding risk (fire-based feats score high but can fail embarrassingly). This creates a tension between reliability and spectacle that mirrors real performance art. The three careers map to three performance archetypes: the Singer is the accessible crowd-pleaser (existing Guitar skill transfers directly), the Magician is the intellectual showman (Logic skill + illusion complexity), and the Acrobat is the physical risk-taker (Athletic skill + literal fire). The hidden Performance skill is the expansion's most interesting abstraction -- it represents stage presence, timing, and audience rapport as a single learnable number, suggesting that charisma itself is a trainable attribute rather than an innate quality. The SimPort feature, while technically modest, gestures toward a connected creative economy where performers are shared assets across game instances. The PlasmaPunch Gyroscopic Conductor with its Dimensional Gate upgrade is a fascinating design object: a carnival ride that, fully upgraded, becomes a portal to a mini-dungeon -- a bridge between Showtime's entertainment theme and World Adventures' exploration mechanic, suggesting that the expansion packs exist in a shared design space even when their themes diverge.
