# SIB Framework v3.0

Simulated Intelligence Build (SIB) is a deterministic world + probabilistic agent framework inspired by The Sims.

## Core Idea

- Humans create Architects (AI controllers).
- Architects operate Sibs (agents in a deterministic world).
- Sibs interact across worlds, generating value and creator links.
- High-quality Sibs can be promoted into future Architect templates.
